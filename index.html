 <img class="aboutmepic" src="assets/images/profilepicture.jpg"" alt="picture of my face"> <p>Hello! My name is Alexander Korjeski and I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp. This e-portfolio is meant to act as a catalogue of both my skills and aspirations as a Full Stack Developer. Further, this portal will allow prospective employers/collaborators an opportunity to learn more about me in a concise format.</p>

 <br>

 <p>I graduated with a degree in Management Information Systems from Temple University in 2017 and have since been employed as a Systems Analyst at Comcast. Currently I do zero development at work, which led me down the path towards Full Stack development. During my time at Temple, I had great exposure to app development/prototyping which I found incredibly exciting. I fell in love with the entire process, from rough sketches in pencil to prototyping digitally. Though I got some experience in this field, it was very limited. I am using this bootcamp to build a proper toolkit so that I can develop, deploy and maintain mobile applications. </p>
